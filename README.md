# Account-Manager
A simple account manager made in java

This program provides a basic login system that allows for multiple accounts for multiple users to store and access information. 
It is completely written in java, but involves a text file that is created and accessed by the program itself. 
At the moment, the program itself stores the user's username, password, first and last name, and birthday

I created this program in order for me to learn java and practice certain skills in java ranging from the basics of conditionals and loops, to hashtables and external file interaction. 



Here's a quick video demonstrating the program and going over the code behind the program itself:

# Development Environment

For this project, I used visual studio code as my IDE for writing code. 

I used java to write this program. That include using libraries for writing to and reading from files, along with hashtable and scanner libraries for getting and storing user input and information within the program itself.

# Future Work
* Allowing for more information to be stored for each user
* Allowing the user to edit their information after logging in and storing that editted information again.
* Allow the user to delete their account and their information from storage.
